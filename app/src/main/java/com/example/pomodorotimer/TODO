 -  Add intent to notification and delete notification after app is opened.

 -  Status should also include which session is playing.

 -  In order to clean the code we could make a class, displayer, that gets all the interactive views
    of the mainActivity, and that intercats directly with the clock.class, in order to keep the views
    updated

 -  Clean the code.

 -  Fix progress max bug: the max is changed every time the countdown is resumed.

 -  Probably better to send a custom notification when the whole session has ended.

 -  Put two session counters, the first one displays in a clear color all the sessions before a long play.
    The second one adds one dark mark over the the other displayer every time a work sessions is completed.

 -  Saving a SessionPreferences object in SharedPreferences instead of the 4 preferences individually.

 -  Probably would be cleaner to use an array to control the session. The size would be the number
    of sessionsBeforeLongBreak. Each session adds a new value to the array, which leads it to the next
    session (either work or break). When the array reaches a number of values equal to its size minus 1
    the longBreak sessions is called.
    Another possibility could be using a boolean (or just an int with two values) and an int counting
    the number of completed sessions. Instead of a switch or a if/else distribution the system will
    selected either work or break depending on this two values, and will start the longbreak when the
    int counting the values reaches the number of sessionsBeforeLongBreak x2 -1.

 X  Saving changes without playing the app even once crashes the app.

 X  Refill the progress bar when the countdown is stopped.

 X  Restarting the countdown doesn't restart the progressBar progress.

 X  Saving changes should update the time displayed in the clock.

 X  Save changes button in Settings activity should trigger a alert popup to confirm that they want to
    save the new preferences even tho it will reset the pomodoro timer.

 X  Add alarm sounds

 X  Start of the progressBar should be on the top

 X  Would be even better to just have one floating button, tap once to play, tap again to pause, and
     hold to restart.
