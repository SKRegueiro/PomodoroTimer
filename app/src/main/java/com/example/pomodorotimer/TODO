 - Clean the code

 - Probably would be cleaner to use an array to control the session. The size would be the number
 of sessionsBeforeLongBreak. Each session adds a new value to the array, which leads it to the next
 session (either work or break). When the array reaches a number of values equal to its size minus 1
 the longBreak sessions is called.
 Another possibility could be using a boolean (or just an int with two values) and an int counting
 the number of completed sessions. Instead of a switch or a if/else distribution the system will
 selected either work or break depending on this two values, and will start the longbreak when the
 int counting the values reaches the number of sessionsBeforeLongBreak x2 -1;
