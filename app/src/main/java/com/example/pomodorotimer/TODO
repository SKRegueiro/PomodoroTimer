 - Add notifications and alarm sounds.

 - Clean the code.

 - Stop button before the timer has ever been played crashes the app

 -Save changes button in Settings activity should trigger a alert popup to confirm that they want to
 save the new preferences even tho it will reset the pomodoro timer.

 - Reset on long break to fast. Probably better to let the user know that he finished the longBreak.

 - Put another circle under the main progressbar with a clearer color.

 - Make the stop square bigger

 - Saving a SessionPreferences object in SharedPreferences instead of the 4 preferences individually.

 - Probably would be cleaner to use an array to control the session. The size would be the number
 of sessionsBeforeLongBreak. Each session adds a new value to the array, which leads it to the next
 session (either work or break). When the array reaches a number of values equal to its size minus 1
 the longBreak sessions is called.
 Another possibility could be using a boolean (or just an int with two values) and an int counting
 the number of completed sessions. Instead of a switch or a if/else distribution the system will
 selected either work or break depending on this two values, and will start the longbreak when the
 int counting the values reaches the number of sessionsBeforeLongBreak x2 -1.
